<p>UWP - Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10 Desktop, Windows 10 Tablets, Windows 10 Mobile Phones, Windows 10 Pixelsense, Windows 10 IOT, Windows Server, Windows 10 HoloLens, and Windows 10 Xbox.</p>

<p>Some UWP libraries are PCL based and should also work with Android and Apple IOS via Xamarin. PCL targeted at .NET 3 also work with Unity 3D as another way of targeting Android and IOS. This List is currently focused on Windows 10 devices but I'll try to call out other targets. The introduction of .NET Core should also help in this area.</p>

<p>On a Windows 10 Desktop or Tablet, a UWP App is typically deployed to a safe sandboxed environment via the Windows Store but the App can also be easily sideloaded to access legacy Windows 10 Desktop features and services with the <a href="https://github.com/lancecontreras/BCTemplates">BCTemplates</a>  project being an example of one approach. This process has become very convenient with the Anniversary Update and is a simple setting in "Update &amp; security" which makes a Windows 10 Tablet and Windows 10 Mobile device a very convenient deployment device for all kinds of touch based applications out in the "Real World"</p>

<p>This is extensive list (in progress) of potentially useful UWP Tools, Libraries, Samples etc to help make your UWP development more awesome. The list is non-curated (but with opininated comments when available). The ultimate objective is to provide a broad starting point for UWP development to perhaps help to offset the currently chaotic and sporadic information that is generally available.</p>

<p>All contributions are welcome. Try to include a Title, Link, Description but any comment is welcome. Adding an GitHub Issue is another low effort way to add something here. I'll even try to insert any editorial type comments you might want to share in order to make this document a bit more interesting to read over and above a rather dry list of projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Appsample-Photosharing">Photo Sharing App</a> UWP app sample that demonstrates real-world social media experiences around photo sharing.</p>

<p>PhotoSharingApp is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that demonstrates real-world social media experiences around photo sharing.</p>

<p>With this app, users can earn virtual gold by uploading and sharing photos with people from all around the world. They can upload photos of their cats, shoes, houses, or last vacations, and see how they compete against other users. Are their photos a great gold source? Are they among the most generous contributors? They can find out on the app's leaderboard.</p>

<p>The goal of this app is to provide a complete, end-to-end example of a real-world app that uses a variety of UWP features, and exhibits design and development best practices. This makes it a great source of code you can copy into your own apps. It also provides an example of what a real-world app architecture might look like. The decoupled architecture makes it easy to reuse code or to make changes and build your own photo sharing app, which you can then publish in the Windows Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes">Family notes</a></p>

<p>FamilyNotes is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores different input modalities and scenarios of user awareness. The FamilyNotes sample is essentially a bulletin board app that allows family members to leave notes for each other on a common PC/tablet just like they would a bulletin board. Using text, speech, ink, or pictures, a user can create a note and tag it for another user. Later when that other user approaches the PC/Tablet, the app uses imaging APIs and the Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API) to detect their presence and display the notes that have been left for them, effectively filtering based on facial recognition. While the app is open, users can naturally interact with it using speech (“Add note for Bob”). If the app isn’t open, a user can easily launch it and interact with it using Cortana.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller">Hue light controller</a></p>

<p>HueLightController is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores integrating Windows features with intelligent home automation. Specifically, it shows how you can use Cortana and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) to create an interactive experience with the Phillips Hue Lights (a Wi-Fi enabled lighting system). </p>

<p>With Cortana integration, users are able to naturally interact with the lights through speech. They can turn the lights off, change their color, or even engage with Cortana in a back-and-forth conversation to adjust a specific light or change all the lights at once.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller/raw/master/Screenshots/Connecting.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Additionally, through Bluetooth LE, the app supports a proximity scenario where the lights are automatically turned on/off depending on a user's device relative to a Bluetooth LE beacon. </p>

<ul>
<li>   Using the HttpClient methods and Newtonsoft.json to interact with the Hue lights' RESTful interface.</li>
<li>   Extending Cortana to provide an intuitive voice interface for manipulating the lights.</li>
<li>   Using BLE APIs in the background to watch for a BLE beacon indicating proximity to the lights.</li>

This folder contains a powershell script, Generate-AppxMsi.ps1, that packages an appx file into an msi. It will also embed an installation script that will enable sideloading in the registry, trust the application cert if it is not already trusted and deploy the application. Currently this script is a proof of concept with hardcoded values, but later on it will be able to wrap any appx or appx bundle like this and read all the relevant information from the package directly. Appx installer is a file handler for appx files. Using it, when a appx file is double clicked, a window is shown with information about the app. The user can then click install to install the app.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. Microsoft uses SQLite as a core component of Windows 10, and in individual numerous products. <a href="https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki">System.Data.SQLite</a> System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET provider for SQLite.

<p><a href="https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net">sqlite-net</a> sqlite-net is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in SQLite 3 databases. It is written in C# and is meant to be simply compiled in with your projects. It was first designed to work with MonoTouch on the iPhone, but has grown up to work on all the platforms (Mono for Android, .NET, Silverlight, WP7, WinRT, Azure, etc.). Very simple methods for executing CRUD operations and queries safely (using parameters) and for retrieving the results of those query in a strongly typed fashion. Works with your data model without forcing you to change your classes. (Contains a small reflection-driven ORM layer.)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw">SQLitePCL.raw</a> SQLitePCL.raw is a Portable Class Library (PCL) for low-level (raw) access to SQLite. This library is designed to be the common portable layer upon which friendlier wrappers can be built. Right now, every C# SQLite library writes their own P/Invoke and COM and marshaling and stuff. Build on this library instead and focus more on the upper layer and its goal of providing a pleasant, easy-to-use API for app developers. When people ask me to recommend a friendlier SQLite wrapper, sqlite-net is the one that I usually recommend. SQLitePCL.pretty is another friendly SQLite API wrapper. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bordoley/SQLitePCL.pretty">SQLitePCL.pretty</a> This library wraps the C like SQLiteAPI provided by SQLitePCL.raw with a friendly C# object oriented API. It adds an Async API. SQLitePCL.pretty has a very simple table mapping ORM, available in the SQLitePCL.pretty.Orm package on nuget. It supports inserting both new and existing objects, and finding and deleting objects by primary key, from SQLite database tables. Notably, the ORM is designed to make working with immutable data types much easier by supporting the builder pattern for deserializing database objects. Ineresting features include the ability to iterate through query result sets using LINQ, support for binary streaming of data in and out of SQLite using .NET streams, and a powerful async API built on the RX framework."</p>

However, it supports a limited subset of XAML, and no HTML. In scenario's where you want to display a field that contains HTML rich formatted text (e.g. when you have clients on multiple platforms, such as web, WinRT, iOS and Android), this package offers an alternative to using an embedded browser control.

<p><a href="https://github.com/scionwest/ValidatableBase">ValidatableBase</a> Model Validation for Universal WinRT Apps through delegate method invocation per-property or DataAnnotation styled attribute validation. Added validation interception support. You may now have the built-in validation rules invoke a delegate method. This provides you with a little more flexibility when performing validation. You may piggy back on top of existing rules for minor checks instead of resorting to a full delegate validation method. By letting your model inherit from ValidatableBase, you can force validation checks on a model from within your view model. Binding to the view is really easy, using one of the two provided converters. The library comes with support for validating minimum and maximum numeric values, ranges of numeric values, string length, null objects, empty collections, empty or null strings and custom delegate method invocation. If you want to write your own attribute validation, you just need to implement IValidationRule and then decorate your object.</p>

SSDP allows you to discover devices and services on a (local) network. RSSDP is designed primarily to publish and discover custom or 'basic' devices, and as such does not implement the full UPnP device architecture. If you are looking to build a device for which a full UPnP device schema exists, this is not the library for you (sorry! though I guess you can fork and extend if you like). If you are looking for a way to discover a custom service (such as a proprietary REST or SOAP service) from a device, RSSDP might be the solution for you.</p>

The WriteableBitmap class is available for all XAML flavors including Windows Phone, WPF, WinRT Windows Store XAML, (Windows 10) UWP and Silverlight. It was even ported to Windows Embedded. WriteableBitmapEx allows the direct manipulation of a bitmap and can be used for image manipulation, to generate fast procedural images by drawing directly to a bitmap and more. The WriteableBitmap API is very minimalistic and there's only the raw Pixels array for such operations. The WriteableBitmapEx library tries to compensate that with extensions methods that are easy to use like built in methods and offer GDI+ like functionality. The library extends the WriteableBitmap class with elementary and fast (2D drawing) functionality, conversion methods and functions to combine (blit) WriteableBitmaps. The extension methods are grouped into different C# files using a partial class approach. It is possible to include just a few methods by using the specific source code files directly or the full functionality via the built binaries. </p>
