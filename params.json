When you can, please consider giving feedback to the authors, testing their code and filing issue reports/feature requests and hit the Star button for their project. If your favorite project is missing from this list, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n#  :ballot_box_with_check: The-UWP-Tools-List\r\n\r\nUWP - Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10 Desktop, Windows 10 Tablets, Windows 10 Mobile Phones, Windows 10 Pixelsense, Windows 10 IOT, Windows Server, Windows 10 HoloLens, and Windows 10 Xbox.\r\n\r\nSome UWP libraries are PCL based and should also work with Android and Apple IOS via Xamarin. PCL targeted at .NET 3 also work with Unity 3D as another way of targeting Android and IOS. This List is currently focused on Windows 10 devices but I'll try to call out other targets. The introduction of .NET Core should also help in this area.\r\n\r\nOn a Windows 10 Desktop or Tablet, a UWP App is typically deployed to a safe sandboxed environment via the Windows Store but the App can also be easily sideloaded to access legacy Windows 10 Desktop features and services with the [BCTemplates](https://github.com/lancecontreras/BCTemplates)  project being an example of one approach. This process has become very convenient with the Anniversary Update and is a simple setting in \"Update & security\" which makes a Windows 10 Tablet and Windows 10 Mobile device a very convenient deployment device for all kinds of touch based applications out in the \"Real World\"\r\n\r\nThis is extensive list (in progress) of potentially useful UWP Tools, Libraries, Samples etc to help make your UWP development more awesome. The list is non-curated (but with opininated comments when available). The ultimate objective is to provide a broad starting point for UWP development to perhaps help to offset the currently chaotic and sporadic information that is generally available.\r\n\r\nAll contributions are welcome. Try to include a Title, Link, Description but any comment is welcome. Adding an GitHub Issue is another low effort way to add something here. I'll even try to insert any editorial type comments you might want to share in order to make this document a bit more interesting to read over and above a rather dry list of projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Microsoft\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that current Microsoft Emulators are based on Hyper-V which is a low overhead VM technology. To painlessly fire up emulators, you need both a modern CPU that supports SLAT instructions and the \"Pro\" version of Windows 10.\r\n\r\n### Microsoft Downloads and tools for Windows 10\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads\r\n\r\n[Windows App Certification Kit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/develop/app-certification-kit) This is an often overlooked gem.

They can upload photos of their cats, shoes, houses, or last vacations, and see how they compete against other users. Are their photos a great gold source? Are they among the most generous contributors? They can find out on the app's leaderboard.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this app is to provide a complete, end-to-end example of a real-world app that uses a variety of UWP features, and exhibits design and development best practices. This makes it a great source of code you can copy into your own apps. It also provides an example of what a real-world app architecture might look like. The decoupled architecture makes it easy to reuse code or to make changes and build your own photo sharing app, which you can then publish in the Windows Store.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Appsample-Photosharing/raw/master/Images/Category-Overview-Desktop-Mobile.jpg)\r\n\r\n-    Browse photo categories and navigate into photo collections and photo details.\r\n-    Take and upload photos directly in the app or upload an existing photo.\r\n-    Give gold and add comments to photos uploaded by other users.\r\n-    Receive push notifications when users are given gold for uploaded photos.\r\n-    Explore a leaderboard of users with the most gold, users that have given the most gold to other photos, and the photos that have received the most gold.\r\n-    Sign in with a Microsoft, Facebook, Google, or Twitter account.\r\n-    Report content as abusive, inappropriate, or spam.\r\n-    Buy virtual gold using in-app purchase.\r\n\r\n- Adaptive UI using the SplitView control (see video on Channel 9) and adaptive triggers:\r\n- In-app purchase (see the Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace):\r\n- Separation between user interface, business logic and data models (MVVM):\r\n- Extensibility and flexibility using the Unity dependency container:\r\n- How to connect your app to an Azure App Service\r\n- Real-world service implementation for storing uploaded photos using Azure DocumentDB\r\n- Sign-in with Azure Mobile Apps:\r\n- Usage analysis with Visual Studio Application Insights\r\n- Push Notifications (see Integration with App Service Mobile Apps in Azure Notification Hubs:\r\n\r\n[Rss Reader](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-rssreader) A UWP app sample for retrieving RSS feeds and viewing articles, demonstrating adaptive layout and hierarchical navigation patterns.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-rssreader/blob/master/RssReader.png)\r\n\r\n- The navigation menu (hamburger menu) pattern and screen-width adaptivity using the SplitView control and the AdaptiveTrigger class.\r\n- The Syndication APIs (Windows.Web.Syndication) to retrieve RSS feed data.\r\n- The DataContractSerializer class to save and restore app data from local storage.\r\n- C# and XAML using the MVVM design pattern.\r\n\r\nMarch 2016 update:\r\n\r\n- A complete redesign of the UI to show effective use of color, type, images, and animated effects.\r\n- Major improvements to layout, navigation, and window-size adaptivity to support small and large screens.\r\n- Use of the WebView control to show articles within the app.\r\n- The ability to rename feeds and to rearrange feeds and favorites.\r\n\r\nWe implemented the navigation and layout patterns in this sample using code from the XAML navigation menu and XAML master/detail samples in the Windows-universal-samples repo. These samples represent the current minimum recommendations for these patterns, and the RssReader sample will continue to reflect this guidance in future updates. \r\n\r\n[Family notes](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes)\r\n\r\nFamilyNotes is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores different input modalities and scenarios of user awareness. The FamilyNotes sample is essentially a bulletin board app that allows family members to leave notes for each other on a common PC/tablet just like they would a bulletin board. Using text, speech, ink, or pictures, a user can create a note and tag it for another user. Later when that other user approaches the PC/Tablet, the app uses imaging APIs and the Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API) to detect their presence and display the notes that have been left for them, effectively filtering based on facial recognition. While the app is open, users can naturally interact with it using speech (“Add note for Bob”). If the app isn’t open, a user can easily launch it and interact with it using Cortana.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes/raw/master/Screenshots/Using_Ink_Voice_and_Face_Recognition_in_a_UWP_App_Video.PNG)\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-familynotes/raw/master/Screenshots/FamilyNotes.PNG)\r\n\r\n-    Speech recognition and speech synthesis by using the SpeechRecognizer and SpeechSynthesizer classes.\r\n-    User detection using the MediaCapture and FaceDetectionEffect classes.\r\n-    User facial recognition using the Microsoft Face API.\r\n-    Activation through Cortana voice commands, defined in VoiceCommands.xml (a VCD file), using VoiceCommands and Activation classes.\r\n-    Pen input using the InkCanvas API\r\n-    JSON serialization using the DataContractJsonSerializer class.\r\n-    Setting the app wallpaper using the Bing image of the day task snippet.\r\n\r\n[Hue light controller](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller)\r\n\r\nHueLightController is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that explores integrating Windows features with intelligent home automation. Specifically, it shows how you can use Cortana and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) to create an interactive experience with the Phillips Hue Lights (a Wi-Fi enabled lighting system). \r\n\r\nWith Cortana integration, users are able to naturally interact with the lights through speech. They can turn the lights off, change their color, or even engage with Cortana in a back-and-forth conversation to adjust a specific light or change all the lights at once.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-huelightcontroller/raw/master/Screenshots/Connecting.png)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, through Bluetooth LE, the app supports a proximity scenario where the lights are automatically turned on/off depending on a user's device relative to a Bluetooth LE beacon. \r\n\r\n-    Using the HttpClient methods and Newtonsoft.json to interact with the Hue lights' RESTful interface.\r\n-    Extending Cortana to provide an intuitive voice interface for manipulating the lights.\r\n-    Using BLE APIs in the background to watch for a BLE beacon indicating proximity to the lights.\r\n-    Showing an extended splash screen for more time while the app connects to the Hue hub and searches for lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Traffic app](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp) and the [MVVM Version](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp/tree/MVVM)\r\n\r\nTraffic App is a sample Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app for commuters to track drive times to various locations. The user adds frequently-visited destinations using app-bar buttons or by tapping and holding on the map. Traffic App then provides a quick view into how long it will take to drive to each place from the user’s current location, following the fastest route. The user can also flag a particular destination and a background task will periodically monitor traffic to that location, alerting the user when traffic is adding ten minutes or more to the travel time. \r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-trafficapp/raw/MVVM/Images/TrafficApp.png)\r\n\r\n-    MapControl and MapItemsControl (Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps)\r\n-    Geolocator (Windows.Devices.Geolocation)\r\n-    MapLocationFinder and MapRouteFinder (Windows.Services.Maps)\r\n-    Background tasks (Windows.ApplicationModel.Background)\r\n-    Toast notifications (Windows.UI.Notifications)\r\n-    Local storage and serialization (Windows.Storage)\r\n\r\n[Network helper](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper) NetworkHelper library and Quiz Game\r\n\r\nNetworkHelper is a sample library that demonstrates the use UWP networking APIs to enable network discovery and communication in your games or apps. Specifically, the library provides the ability for:\r\n\r\n-    Wi-Fi network discovery and management peer clients over a local Wi-Fi network.\r\n-    Direct communication between discovered devices on the same Wi-Fi network with developer configurable messages.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper/raw/master/Screenshots/QuizGame_JoinGame_scaled.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-appsample-networkhelper/raw/master/Screenshots/QuizGame_GameInProgress_scaled.png)\r\n\r\nQuizGame is a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample that uses the NetworkHelper library to enable a pub-style trivia game. When running the sample, you are presented with an option to create a new game as a quiz master on your local network or join an existing game and answer questions from the quiz master. Questions appear on the quiz master's screen while players answer the questions on their own devices. A quiz master can advance the game to additional questions and display the scores at the end. Below are some features that QuizGame uses.\r\n\r\n-    Simple MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel) coding pattern\r\n-    Simple navigation using code-behind files.\r\n-    NetworkHelper to enable discovery and broadcasting of available games on the local network.\r\n-    NetworkHelper to enable communication between the game and players.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Marble Maze](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-appsample-marble-maze)\r\n\r\nMarble Maze is a sample Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and DirectX app that demonstrates how to build a basic 3D game using DirectX. This game is a simple labyrinth game where the player is challenged to roll a marble through a maze of pitfalls using tilt controls.\r\n\r\nThis sample is written in C++ and requires some experience with graphics programming and DirectX.

Over time, I hope to have just about everything I can find on GitHub and anywhere else so examine all code carefully before using (but the great glory of open source is that the code speaks for itself) and make sure it has a license you are happy with.  \r\n\r\n# Tools\r\n\r\nNote to add some actual Tools that might be handy for UWP development.\r\n\r\n[IconCreatorForUWP](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton/IconCreatorForUWP) IconCreator helps you (developers) create icons of you UWP apps. Just simply import your .png icon file and click the start button. \r\n\r\n[AppxInstaller](https://github.com/aL3891/AppxInstaller) This repostitory was created in respose to some misconceptions and incorrect information about the universal windows platform (UWP) apps, specifically with regards to their dependency on the windows store and suppsed inability to be distributed outside it. This folder contains a powershell script, Generate-AppxMsi.ps1, that packages an appx file into an msi. It will also embed an installation script that will enable sideloading in the registry, trust the application cert if it is not already trusted and deploy the application. Currently this script is a proof of concept with hardcoded values, but later on it will be able to wrap any appx or appx bundle like this and read all the relevant information from the package directly. Appx installer is a file handler for appx files. Using it, when a appx file is double clicked, a window is shown with information about the app. The user can then click install to install the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Database\r\n\r\n[EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework) Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. The ONLY UWP option is SQLite and [it is a mess](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/providers/sqlite/limitations.html). [Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/platforms/uwp/getting-started.html) (Opinionated Note: \"Microsoft's recommended data access technology\" has somehow ended up in the damaged situation of SQLite being the ONLY supported target for Microsoft's main thing, the Universal Windows Platform. The insanely stupid SQLite FK mess means that Entity Framework's Magic Unicorn (Migrations) becomes a useless broken technology on the One Microsoft platform that should count as the highest priority effort. UWP without an easy robust Microsoft supported data platform is a Microsoft blind spot that has been a drag on the success of the Win RT platform from the beginning. \"You can workaround some of these limitations by manually writing code in your migrations to perform a table rebuild. A table rebuild involves renaming the existing table, creating a new table, copying data to the new table, and dropping the old table. You will need to use the Sql(string) method to perform some of these steps.\" (https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/329) There is an explanation in this issue: [ESENT database provider](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/4423) which probably translates to \"please hold\" for another few months)  \r\n\r\n### SQLite\r\n\r\n[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. The source code for SQLite is in the public domain. Microsoft uses SQLite as a core component of Windows 10, and in individual numerous products. [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET provider for SQLite.  Development and maintenance work is now mostly performed by the SQLite Development Team. The SQLite team is committed to supporting System.Data.SQLite long-term. [git mirror of SQLite](https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite) - [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) Official home of the DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) project. Previously known as \"SQLite Database Browser\" and \"Database Browser for SQLite\".

It is written in C# and is meant to be simply compiled in with your projects. It was first designed to work with MonoTouch on the iPhone, but has grown up to work on all the platforms (Mono for Android, .NET, Silverlight, WP7, WinRT, Azure, etc.). Very simple methods for executing CRUD operations and queries safely (using parameters) and for retrieving the results of those query in a strongly typed fashion. Works with your data model without forcing you to change your classes. (Contains a small reflection-driven ORM layer.)\r\n\r\n[SQLitePCL.raw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw) SQLitePCL.raw is a Portable Class Library (PCL) for low-level (raw) access to SQLite. This library is designed to be the common portable layer upon which friendlier wrappers can be built. Right now, every C# SQLite library writes their own P/Invoke and COM and marshaling and stuff. Build on this library instead and focus more on the upper layer and its goal of providing a pleasant, easy-to-use API for app developers. When people ask me to recommend a friendlier SQLite wrapper, sqlite-net is the one that I usually recommend. SQLitePCL.pretty is another friendly SQLite API wrapper. \r\n\r\n[SQLitePCL.pretty](https://github.com/bordoley/SQLitePCL.pretty) This library wraps the C like SQLiteAPI provided by SQLitePCL.raw with a friendly C# object oriented API. It adds an Async API. SQLitePCL.pretty has a very simple table mapping ORM, available in the SQLitePCL.pretty.Orm package on nuget. It supports inserting both new and existing objects, and finding and deleting objects by primary key, from SQLite database tables. Notably, the ORM is designed to make working with immutable data types much easier by supporting the builder pattern for deserializing database objects. Ineresting features include the ability to iterate through query result sets using LINQ, support for binary streaming of data in and out of SQLite using .NET streams, and a powerful async API built on the RX framework.\"\r\n\r\n### ESENT\r\n\r\n[ESENT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/gg269181%28v=exchg.10%29.aspx) Extensible Storage Engine is built into and is available for use on every Windows computer and has been an approved DLL for Windows Store since Windows 8.0. Updates to the database are implemented with a transaction in order to ensure secure operations. ESE enables simultaneous access to multiple databases, including transaction-log file databases that can be used for system recovery. ESE is scalable to large or small applications.

Added validation interception support. You may now have the built-in validation rules invoke a delegate method. This provides you with a little more flexibility when performing validation. You may piggy back on top of existing rules for minor checks instead of resorting to a full delegate validation method. By letting your model inherit from ValidatableBase, you can force validation checks on a model from within your view model. Binding to the view is really easy, using one of the two provided converters. The library comes with support for validating minimum and maximum numeric values, ranges of numeric values, string length, null objects, empty collections, empty or null strings and custom delegate method invocation.

SSDP allows you to discover devices and services on a (local) network. RSSDP is designed primarily to publish and discover custom or 'basic' devices, and as such does not implement the full UPnP device architecture. If you are looking to build a device for which a full UPnP device schema exists, this is not the library for you (sorry! though I guess you can fork and extend if you like). If you are looking for a way to discover a custom service (such as a proprietary REST or SOAP service) from a device, RSSDP might be the solution for you.\r\n\r\n[PoolSharp](https://github.com/Yortw/PoolSharp) PoolSharp is a simple, light weight, thread safe object pool.

The WriteableBitmap class is available for all XAML flavors including Windows Phone, WPF, WinRT Windows Store XAML, (Windows 10) UWP and Silverlight. It was even ported to Windows Embedded. WriteableBitmapEx allows the direct manipulation of a bitmap and can be used for image manipulation, to generate fast procedural images by drawing directly to a bitmap and more. The WriteableBitmap API is very minimalistic and there's only the raw Pixels array for such operations. The WriteableBitmapEx library tries to compensate that with extensions methods that are easy to use like built in methods and offer GDI+ like functionality. The library extends the WriteableBitmap class with elementary and fast (2D drawing) functionality, conversion methods and functions to combine (blit) WriteableBitmaps. The extension methods are grouped into different C# files using a partial class approach. It is possible to include just a few methods by using the specific source code files directly or the full functionality via the built binaries. \r\n\r\n[ImagingUWP](https://github.com/asiertarancon/ImagingUWP) UWP app with Lumia Imaging SDK\r\n\r\n# Graphics 3D\r\n[SharpDX](http://sharpdx.org/) SharpDX is an open-source managed .NET wrapper of the DirectX API.
